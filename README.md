# Convert_AI_to_AV
This python code takes a csv file downloaded from http://mesowest.utah.edu for antelope island, and turns it into a format tha can be uploaded into AQS. 

# Getting Started
To get this program working you just need to save the python file to a computer that has a python IDE.

I recommend anaconda/spyder as a python IDE, but choose whatever you want. This was built and works on python 3.7.

also need these modules in pyhton

python -comes with anaconda

## Usage example:

1) Place the audit files you want to upload in your folder of choice. ie.g. U://PLAN/AMC/BCUBRICH/AI Data
2) Run this script
3) Select the file you need to processs using the prompt, e.g. U://PLAN/AMC/BCUBRICH/AI Data/your_file.csv
4) Select the time period for the file you uploaded.
5) Code will run, and write an output file in the same folder, with the same name. but ending with '_1hr.csv'
6) Upload the output file 'your_file_1hr.csv' to air vision
